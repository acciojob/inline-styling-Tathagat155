	<div><h1 id="f1">Flowers photos</h1><p>A flower is the reproductive part of a flowering plant, also known as a bloom or blossom. It contains the male stamen (anther and filament) and the female carpel (stigma, style, and ovary), and is often a prominent, colorful part designed to attract pollinators for seed production. The four main parts are the petals, sepals, stamens, and carpels, arranged in distinct whorls on the plant's floral axis</p></div>

Ranging from miniature plants to tall climbers, roses display diverse forms and come in many colors, with common uses in gardens, perfumes, and jams made from their fruit, the rose hip.
